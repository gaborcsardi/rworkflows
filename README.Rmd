## Intro

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) 
are a powerful way to automatically launch workflows 
every time you push changes to a GitHub repository. 
This is a form of [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/about-continuous-integration),
which helps ensure that your code is always working as expected 
(without having to manually check each time).

Here, we have designed robust and flexible workflows 
specifically for the development of R packages. 

Currently, these workflows perform the following tasks:  

1. Build a Docker container to run subsequent steps within. 
2. Build and check your R package (with CRAN and Bioconductor checks).  
3. Run units tests.  
4. Run code coverage tests and upload the results 
to [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/).  
5. (Re)build and launch a documentation website for your R package.  
6. Push an [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) 
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container to 
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) 
with your package and all its dependencies pre-installed.  

Importantly, these files are designed to work with any R package out-of-the-box.
This means you won't have to manually edit any of the files provided here, 
simply copy and paste them into the appropriate folders.

## Documentation

### [Website](https://neurogenomics.github.io/rworkflows)
### [Docker/Singularity](https://neurogenomics.github.io/rworkflows/articles/docker)

## Setup 

### 1. Create your R package

If you haven't already [created your R package](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486488-Developing-Packages-with-the-RStudio-IDE), 
you can use [`templateR`](https://github.com/neurogenomics/templateR) as a CRAN/Bioconductor-ready template.

### 2. Setup GitHub Secrets 

GitHub now lets you store "Secrets" within each repo. 
These are basically hidden variables that no one but the repo admins 
can see/edit. 

See here for instructions on how to create [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-repository-and-organization-for-github-codespaces) 
and [GitHub Organization Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/managing-codespaces-for-your-organization/managing-encrypted-secrets-for-your-repository-and-organization-for-github-codespaces#adding-secrets-for-an-organization). 

You will need to store the following variables as Secrets in your GitHub repo.

* `PAT_GITHUB`: <Your GitHub Personal Authentication Token 
generated [via the following instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)>  
* `DOCKER_USERNAME`: <Your DockerHub username. 
[Create an account](https://hub.docker.com/signup) if you haven't already>  
* `DOCKER_ORG`: <Your DockerHub organization name (e.g. "neurogenomicslab"). If you're pushing to your personal DockerHub account instead, this will be the same as `DOCKER_USERNAME`>  
* `DOCKER_TOKEN`: <Your DockerHub access token generated 
[via the following instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/)>   

### 3. Copy files
 
Copy the following folders/files into the folder where your
R package's project folder. 

```
mkdir -p <my_package_folder>/.github/

scp https://github.com/neurogenomics/rworkflows/raw/master/.github/workflows/test.yml <my_package_folder>/.github/workflows/

scp https://github.com/neurogenomics/rworkflows/raw/master/test-document-deploy/Dockerfile <my_package_folder>/.github/workflows/
```  

**NOTE**: When copying files, you will need to use the exact folder structure 
used in this repo, including the fact that `.github/` starts with a `.`. 
This means it will be a "hidden" folder, but you can still view it 
within the "Files" window in Rstudio,
or by running `ls -lah` within the command line.


## Push to GitHub

Now, these workflows will automatically be run every time you push changes
to your GitHub repo.  

```
git add .
git commit -m "<commit message>"
git push
```

You can then monitor the progress and view the results of your workflows 
via the *"Actions"* tab of your GitHub repo. 

**NOTE**: If you do not see an *"Actions"* tab, go to *Settings --> Actions* and
make sure "Actions permissions" is activated. 


## File descriptions 

<details>

### `.github/workflows/check-bioc-docker.yml` 

Steps 1-5 [above](https://github.com/neurogenomics/rworkflows#Intro). 

This workflow is derived from the workflow generated by the 
[`use_bioc_github_action()`](https://lcolladotor.github.io/biocthis/articles/biocthis.html) function within the 
[`biothis`](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/biocthis.html) 
package. This workflow takes advantage of several key features: 

- Uses the official [`Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker`](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker) Docker container
(to minimise errors due to versioning conflicts/missing dependencies).    
- Uses the package
[AnVIL](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/AnVIL.html) to more
rapidly install R packages from binaries.  

However, I have modified the `bioc` workflow to make a number of improvements:  

- Uses dynamic variables to specify R/Bioconductor versions 
(e.g. `r: "latest"`) and the name of your R package, as opposed to static 
names that are likely to become outdated (e.g. `r: "4.0.1"`).  
- Additional error handling and dependencies checks.  
- Re-renders `README.Rmd` before rebuilding the documentation website. 

### `.github/workflows/dockerhub.yml` 

Step 6 [above](https://github.com/neurogenomics/rworkflows#Intro). 

Uses the official 
[`Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker`](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker)
Docker container.  

**NOTE**: The `Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker` container often lags behind the
actual Bioconductor releases. This means that sometimes "devel" in `Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker` is actually referring to the "release" 
version of Bioconductor. See this [Issue](https://github.com/Bioconductor/bioconductor_docker/issues/37) 
for details. 

### `Dockerfile`
 
### Key features 

This Dockerfile is designed for developers of any R package stored on GitHub.
Unlike other Dockerfiles, this one
**does not require any manual editing when applying to different R packages**. 
This means that users who are unfamiliar with Docker do not have to troubleshoot
making this file correctly. It also means that it will continue to work 
even if your R package dependencies change.

It runs several steps:  

  1. Pulls the official bioconductor Docker container (which includes Rstudio).  
  2. Runs CRAN checks on the R package.  
  3. Runs all Bioconductor checks on the R package.  
  3. Installs the R package and all of its dependencies 
  (including `Depends`, `Imports`, and `Suggests`).  

**NOTE**: If any of the CRAN/Bioconductor checks do not pass, 
the Docker container will not be pushed to DockerHub. 
This means you don't have to worry about a faulty version of your package 
accidentally being deployed to DockerHub.

This Dockerfile should be used with the [`dockerhub.yml`](https://github.com/neurogenomics/rworkflows/blob/master/.github/workflows/dockerhub.yml) workflow file,
as you must first checkout the R package from GitHub,
along with several other GitHub Actions.

If the R package passes all checks, the `dockerhub.yml` workflow will subsequently
push the Docker container to DockerHub (using the username and token credentials
stored as GitHub Secrets).
